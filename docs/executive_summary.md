Executive Summary — Context Vault

Context Vault is a secure, on-device personal intelligence system that lets users store their most sensitive data—medical records, identity information, preferences, personal history—and use it with an AI assistant without ever exposing it to a third party.

It combines a secure personal data vault with a local AI model, giving users the power of advanced LLMs with the privacy of offline computing. Context Vault becomes the user’s private, context-aware AI that understands their world, remembers what matters, and works entirely for them—not for advertisers, cloud providers, or data collectors.
